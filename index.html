   <h3>Academic Journey</h3>
   <p>
     After a decade of searching for that elusive "perfect" career field, I can honestly
     say I'm happy with my decision to go into Information Technology.
     I've dabbled in almost every major imaginable, from
     veterinary medicine to electrical engineering. At one point
     I felt like the Goldilocks of academic majors: "This one has too much math!"
     or "This one takes too long!". The ITM program at IIT turned out
     to be fun and the campus is close to the city.
     The cyber security classes are extremely fascinating and really appeal to
     my inner snoop. Accessing the dark web was one of the coolest labs I've ever done.
     We also re-created a Chase Bank login screen with an embedded keylogger.
     Anything that was typed into the fields popped up on a remote UI in Kali Linux.
     A year ago I wouldn't have had the slightest clue what that previous sentence was talking about.
