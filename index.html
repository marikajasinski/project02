   <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
   <p>
     I have spent many years trying to figure out what field of study would be perfect for someone like me. A field I would find interesting, could make money from, and not want to blow my brains out after 10 years of working in it. I've tried many different academic majors, from Veterinary Medicine to Electrical Engineering, yet none of them fit. After learning about the Information Technology and Management program at IIT, I figured I would give it a shot since I've always had a knack for technology.

     The cyber security classes have been fascinating and appeal to
     my inner snoop. So far, I have learned how to access the dark web, make fake websites for phishing scams, and hack into other networks using penetration testing techniques. When I graduate, I would like to secure a career that would use these powers for good and help bring cyber criminals to justice.
